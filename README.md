### Game is in Early Access meaning tons of updates and broken servers. Please post issues so we can make our edits and keep you up and running!

__*DISCLAIMER:  Use this at your own risk.  There is nothing malicious within the script and its all 100% open source readable 
This game is in early access, plan on losing your worlds, issues happening a lot and random bugs with the Official Game    *__    
                                                                                                                    
__*This script is to just get your started.  I will try my best to keep everything updated as I learn issues. Check back often 
                 Check back often for updated vers of the script and server configuration files *__                          

__*Come back and check for updates*__




__*Never run any script on a production server, unless you know what you are doing.*__

```sh
Create VM with minimum 2 CPUs and 4GB of ram. Otherwise server won't start.
```

__*FOR DigitalOcean ONLY - private IP and routing fix for Valheim: *__
```sh

edit 50-cloud-init.yaml

vi /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml

remove private IP address on eth0 (might be 10.10.something - do not remove your public IP the same one you use to SSH into the server or access it)

netplan apply

reboot
```

__*Please do not use the Hosting Company Command Line Interface if you can help it. 
Download putty and connect to your server via SSH. Download Putty here:https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
If you can connect to your Server's Ubuntu install via SSH through PUTTY, your networking/security groups are most likely setup correctly (for port 22).*__  Thanks mscard02
